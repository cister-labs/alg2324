<h1>Introduction and objectives </h1>

This course is about designing algorithms for computational problems, and how to think clearly about analyzing correctness and running time. The main goal is to provide the intellectual tools needed for designing and analyzing your own algorithms for new problems you need to solve in the future.

# Learning outcomes and competences

Students should be able to understand the relationship between algorithm design, correctness proof and complexity analysis. Students should learn algorithmic techniques of general applicability and get to know some major algorithms in a few common domains. They will also obtain practical experience in applying generic algorithms to specific problems.

# Teaching methods and learning activities

Lectures; intermediate test (mandatory) and final test  or final exam.

The lectures mix the presentation of new material (introducing concepts, main algorithms and some results) with interactive discussion of their application when solving real problems.

The homework focus is on practical application of algorithmic concepts, consolidating the learned material. 

The final exam and intermediate tests (closed book), globally evaluates the knowledge acquired by the students.

# Evaluation Type

Distributed evaluation with final exam

### Assessment Components

|designation | Weight (%)|
|------------|-----------|
|Exam |70,00|
|Test | 30,00|


### Amount of time allocated to each course unit

|designation | Time (hours)|
|------------|-------------|
|Home study | 120,00|
|Attendance time | 42,00|
|**Total:** | 162,00|


# Eligibility for exams

All students will be admitted to the exams.


# Calculation formula of final grade

 - (IT) intermediate mid-term test (mandatory) 30%

 - (FE) final exam: 70% (can be replaced by IE)

 - (IE) improvement exam: can replace the final exam. Required IE >= 8.


1st Exam ("Normal") classification: C = max(FE,IE)*0.7+ IT*0.3 >= 9.5

2nd Exam ("Recurso") classification: C = max(FE*0.7+IT*0.3, FE) >= 9.5

Required FE >=8.
